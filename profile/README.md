# Genomic Knowledge Standards for AnVIL

We are scientists and software engineers at [Nationwide Children's Hospital](https://www.nationwidechildrens.org/specialties/institute-for-genomic-medicine/research-labs/wagner-lab) and [Oregon Health & Sciences University](https://ellrottlab.org/) developing libraries and workflows to apply [GA4GH Genomic Knowledge Standards](https://www.ga4gh.org/work_stream/genomic-knowledge-standards/) to data on the [Genomic Analysis, Visualization and Informatics Lab-space (AnVIL)](https://www.genome.gov/Funded-Programs-Projects/Computational-Genomics-and-Data-Science-Program/Genomic-Analysis-Visualization-Informatics-Lab-space-AnVIL) platform.

## Projects

* [Advancing AI-readiness of GREGoR data with GA4GH Genomic Knowledge Standards](https://gregorconsortium.org/members/partner/wagner-research-institute-nationwide-childrens-hospital-research-grant-awardee): transforming GREGoR data into searchable Cohort Allele Frequency objects

## Libraries

* [VRS AnVIL Toolkit](https://github.com/gks-anvil/vrs_anvil_toolkit): Process and perform VRS-based lookups on VCFs. Retrieve evidence from the VICC MetaKB.
* [vrsix](https://github.com/gks-anvil/vrsix): Construct rapidly-searchable indices for VRS-annotated VCFs

## Workflows

* [VRS Annotator](https://github.com/gks-anvil/vrs-annotator): Terra workflow to annotate VCFs with VRS identifiers
* [vrsix-workflow](https://github.com/gks-anvil/vrsix-workflow): Terra workflow for using vrsix to index VRS-annotated VCFs
